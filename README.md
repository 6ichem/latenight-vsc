# Latenight Theme for VS Code

## Installation

I made this theme for myself so i haven't bothered publishing it to the Microsoft marketplace yet

- Open the terminal on the repo folder
- Use `code --install-extension latenight.vsix` to install the theme
- Apply the theme on your editor

**Enjoy!**
